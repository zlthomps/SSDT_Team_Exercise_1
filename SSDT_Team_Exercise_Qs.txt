1) How will you create a base snapshot and commit of this point of time after Activity Commit changes Sprint 1.?

In order to create the database snapshot (.dacpac), I used the Extract Data Tier Application Dialog. I followed these steps:
- First I published my project to my (localdb)\Projects instance
- Next I right clicked on my SSDT_Team_Exercise_1 localdb database in SQL Server Object Explorer within VS and Executed the Extract Data Tier Application Dialog
- I then created a Git Tag for Sprint 1 by selecting Git Browse, then right clicking on my latest commit and selecting Tag

2) How will you deploy the schema to your local development instance of SQL Server after step Commit changes Sprint 2.? Deploy the initial schema 
to your development instance of SQL Server.

To deploy my schema to my local development instance I followed the below steps:
- Right Click on Project > Publsih..
- Created a Profile to point to my local dev SQL DB Instance
- Then published the project to my local dev DB Instance

3) I used the Refactor > Rename process, as this feature conducts a smart rename which will find and update reference to the column or object you're renaming

4) I created a Linked Server between LocalDB and my Development Instance in order to query acrross database servers. I created all necessary inner joins in order to complete necessary lookups for CountryId and StateProvinceId on CountryRegionCode, as all tables have this column in common.

5) I used SSDT to created a database reference, this allows SSDT to use sqlcmd variables and parases values when the project builds or is published

6) I received build warnings due to SELECT * showing up in view, as well as for other reasons, this is due to code analysis being enabled.

Sprint -3 602550452e7d89c6653af5add1fcc4106407d000
Sprint -6 a0bda63ea12420a0f842b9e8a7666e44c0f03b80

I used github.com web-based compare tool to compare the commit hashes for Sprint 3 and 6

9) Sliding Windows because its as simpily updating meta-data pointers as opposed to physically moving data pages and datal
